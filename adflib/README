The ADFlib is written to managed media formatted by the AmigaDos.

It is written in portable C, and support the WinNT platform to access
real drives.

COMPILATION
-----------

It had been tested on Intel/Linux with gcc 2.7.2, Solaris 2.6, and
Win32.
The size of long must be 4, the size of short 2.
The library reads disk sectors written with the big endian (Motorola) byte
ordering.

You have to type :

make clean
make depend
make lib

A 'lidadf.a' should be created.


* Byte ordering

'make clean' remove the temporary files and the 'defendian.h'. In this file,
LITT_ENDIAN must be defined if the target machine uses the little endian 
byte ordering, like this :

#ifndef LITT_ENDIAN
#define LITT_ENDIAN 1
#endif /* LITT_ENDIAN */

This should be done automatically by the 'myconf' shell script. myconf 
autocompiles a C file which detects the byte ordering. The 'defendian.h'
is generated in 'myconf'. 'defendian.h' should be included in every .c file
which uses the LITT_ENDIAN define is used, otherwise the compiler could think
it is not defined, and the target machine is (always) using the big endian
byte ordering.

'myconf' is launched by 'make depend'.


* Native driver

The NATIV_DIR variable is used to choose the (only one) target platform
of the native driver. The default is :

NATIV_DIR = ./Generic

This one do not give access to any real device. The other one available is
Win32, to access real devices under WinNT.


* Win32DLL

The 'prefix.h' is used to create the Win32 DLL version of the library.
If the WIN32DLL variable is defined in the library code, public functions
are preceded by the '__declspec(dllexport)' directive. If this same
variable is defined, the '__declspec(dllimport)' is put before the functions
prototypes in the 'adflib.h' library include file.

Possible bugs
-------------

- in dircache updates
- when a volume is becoming full
- lost memory releases


Please report any bugs or mistakes in the documentation !
